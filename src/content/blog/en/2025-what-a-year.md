What was 2025? I'm still not really sure. I'm thankful that all those important things happened.

Maybe 2026 will have more important things. I'd like to find more interesting challenge for myself in 2026, and perhaps reach a new height through it. So that might happen.

Happy New Year, everyone! See you in 2026![^1]

[^1]: I may or may not update this post later in 2026 to reflect on the year more thoroughly.
